# React-Full-V1

From https://github.com/vikejs/vike/tree/main/examples/react-full-v1

My approach is to use this as a development log. Then rewrite if the project becomes useful.

## 231107 main

This README log.
Next, following amended instructions from the [Vue Full V1 example](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/blob/main/examples/vue-full-v1/readme.md), I will:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vikejs/vike
cd vike/examples/react-full-v1/
npm install
npm run dev
```
